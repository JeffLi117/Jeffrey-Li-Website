      <h2 className="text-2xl text-bold">Hello, I'm Jeffrey Li!</h2>
      <p>I'm a full-stack software developer with a background in medicine. I aim to use my combination of skills to bring about a better quality of life for people around the world. I have created front-end components optimizing user experiences at OptiChroniX, an application for patients with dementia and their caretakers.</p>
      <p>I'm in the process of creating <a href="https://github.com/JeffLi117/Not-In-Vein">Not In Vein</a>, a centralized reminder application to help remind blood donors to keep giving back to others.</p>
      <p>Outside of software, I enjoy eating all the pizza, reading fantasy novels (especially those with dragons!), binging TV shows, and rock climbing.</p>
